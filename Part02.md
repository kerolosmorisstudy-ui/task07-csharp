Difference between class and struct in C#:
	•	Class is reference type (stored in heap).
	•	Struct is value type (stored in stack).
	•	Class supports inheritance; struct does not.
	•	Struct cannot have a parameterless constructor (before C# 10).

Other relations between classes:
	•	Association
	•	Aggregation
	•	Composition
	•	Dependency
